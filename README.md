# etaT-w-at-finite-mub
Tables of T and mub dependent shear viscosity to enthalpy density ratios for use in relativistic viscous hydrodynamic codes simulating HIC at finite baryon density

Tables run across (T,mub). T range [50,800] MeV. mub range [0,~800] MeV (mub range [0,700] MeV for CP BES case)

Four cases of etaT/w(T,mub)  
1. etaT-w CO SMOOTH.txt - crossover transition across {T,mub} with matching of HRG and QGP phases at chiral transition line 
2. etaT-w CO SHARP.txt - crossover transition across {T,mub} with mathcing of HRG and QGP phases at 1.26 * chiral transition line 
3. etaT-w CP BES.txt - transition across {T,mub} with critical point at (T,mub) = (143,350) MeV matching the Equation of State from the Beam Energy Scan Theory Collaboration
4. etaT-w CP HOL.txt - transition across {T,mub} with critical point at (T,mub) = (89,724) MeV matching holographic prediction
